This repo is only a placeholder. I am shoving stuff in here while I
wait for the wmf repo to show up, at which point looking here will
be rather pointless.

If I feel really nice I might keep this in sync; no promises.

What this repo has: draft code for an api to get status information
about mysql/xml dumps of wiki projects.

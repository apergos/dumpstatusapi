For testing I put these files in the following locations:

dumpsstatus.conf      -> /srv/dumpstatus/dumpstatus.conf
dumpstatus.conf.nginx -> /etc/nginx/conf.d/dumpstatus.conf
dumpstatus.ini.uwsgi  -> /etc/uwsgi.d/dumpstatus.ini
uwsgi.ini             -> /etc/uwsgi.ini

Testing done on laptop with Fedora 25, your mileage may vary.
